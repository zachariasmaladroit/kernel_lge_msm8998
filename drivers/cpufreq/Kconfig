config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	select SRCU
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  This governor makes decisions based on the utilization data provided
	  by the scheduler.  It sets the CPU frequency to be proportional to
	  the utilization/capacity ratio coming from the scheduler.  If the
	  utilization is frequency-invariant, the new frequency is also
	  proportional to the maximum available frequency.  If that is not the
	  case, it is proportional to the current frequency of the CPU.  The
